Running
------------         
Ori-Finder is a web-based system for finding oriCs in unannotated bacterial genomes. 

The algorithm is implemented in the language of C++ and the output graphs are generated by gnuplot graphic routine
 (http://www.gnuplot.info/). 

To run the program:
        OriF <fasta-file> [options]
     where,
        <fasta-file>: the sequence in FASTA format.
        
    
     Options are:
        -b  ttatccaca    Choose 'ttatccaca' as species-specific DnaA boxes (Default is ttatccaca). 
                         For more species-specific DnaA boxes (such as 'TTTTCCACA' for Chlamydiae, 'TTATCGAAA' for Dehalococcoides and 'TGTTTCACG' for Bradyrhizobiaceae etc), 
                         please refer to DoriC, a database of oriC regions in bacterial genomes at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/
        -n  n            Choose 'n' as match sites, i.e., scanning nonamers with match sites no less than 'n' positions from the selected DnaA boxes (By default, n = 8). 
        -g               Run the gene-finding program ZCURVE 1.02 to generate the gene list.
        -m               This option should be selected if the gene-finding program ZCURVE 1.02 is run to generate the gene list for mycoplasma genomes (For mycoplasma genomes, the triplet TGA codes for trptomphan).
          
    
    

     The input files should be prepared in the following format.

        Note that the .ptt file should be named after .fna file. For example, the name of the .fna file is NC_000913.fna, then the name of the .ptt file should be named as NC_000913.ptt
                
        
        
Example: Finding oriCs in Escherichia coli K12
--------
        
Take Escherichia coli K12 as an example, which is described as follows.

(i)   All the files (OriF.exe, NC_000913.fna, NC_000913.ppt) would be contained in the same directory, and the absolute path of .fna file should be specified (e.g, all the files are put in the file folder d:\OriFinder).
    
(ii)  The input files would be prepared according to the format defined above.
          
(iii) The system is running as follows,

      OriF d:\OriFinder\NC_000913.fna
 
      You will see some intermediate results of the procedure in the screen.

       	
(iv) The system outputs are listed as follows:


(1) The genome size, GC content, location, length, DnaA box number, the motif of DnaA boxes, the conserved genes adjacent to the predicted oriCs, the precise coordinates of extremes of the four disparity curves and the sequence of identified oriC regions as an HTML table (NC_000913.fna.html)

(2) The DnaA box distribution and the coordinates of four disparity curves as text files; 

(3) The integrated plot for the original sequence and (iv) that for the rotated sequence to display the obtained results, such as general genome information, four disparity curves, distribution of DnaA boxes, locations of indicator genes and oriC regions in PNG format. 

(4) If option '-g' is chosen, the gene list file generated by ZCURVE1.02 will also be output.

Note: Typical bacterial oriCs have many conserved sequence features, including 

(i)   having single oriC in an intergenic region, 
(ii)  having asymmetrical nucleotide distributions around oriCs, 
(iii) sequence between oriC and terminus being about half in length of the entire chromosome, 
(iv)  containing multiple copies of DnaA boxes, 
(v)   close to replication related genes, such as dnaA or dnaN (please also refer to DoriC for more details) 
(vi)  containing repeat sequences, which can be found by web tools, such as REPuter. 


Note: Output graphs can be generated by gnuplot graphic routine (http://www.gnuplot.info/) by 
loading a gnuplot command file (NC_000913.plt) directly. The users need to install the graphics freeware, gnuplot
 where can be downloaded from the website http://www.gnuplot.info/. The gnuplot executables -- wgnuplot.exe (windows)
 are also available in the package. You can type "load 'NC_000913.plt' " (no qutoes) at 
the gnuplot prompt to see the output graphs. Precompiled binary distributions are also available for your convenience. 
If you have problems using these binary distributions to output graphs, you should compile it yourself. Of course, you can 
plot these data files with other scientific plotting software, such as Origin, Matlab, S-Plus, SPSS etc.
